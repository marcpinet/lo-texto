# Lo-Texto

Development of an emergency app (from scratch) with LoRaWAN protocol. This project was made for an internship purpose at Da Nang in Vietnam.


## Prerequisites

* One or more Arduino Pro or Pro Mini boards
* As much HM-10 BLE Module as you have boards
* Cables to link HM-10 with your boards
* A city where LoRaWAN gateways are available
* A raspberry pi or something like that where a Linux OS is installed, will be used as a server
* Python 3.7.0+ (installed on the server)
* MySQL installed on your server (I used MariaDB), if you want to use something else, do not forget to edit the `main.py` file!

Get a copy of the Project. Assuming you have git installed, open your Terminal and enter:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/marcpinet/lo-texto.git'
```
